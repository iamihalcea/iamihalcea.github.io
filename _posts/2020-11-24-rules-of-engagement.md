In this post I'll set forth some rules for myself to follow in all subsequent posts. I might amend these rules as I identify relevant ones or
ones that turn out to be irrelevant.

* Make a clear distinction between opinion and fact. Support facts with references.
* Don't be political. This one might be tricky if some sides attempt to politicise generally apolitical topics. Example: [climate change is apolitical](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/),
but [the policies around it are not](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/policy-context).
* Don't pass someone else's work or ideas as your own - explicitly give credit.
* Don't offer non-technical advice. Don't offer technical advice on something you don't understand thoroughly.
* Don't be offensive for the sake of being offensive. Again - tricky, given the subjectivity around what is "offensive". I'll do my best.
* Don't be condescending to someone else's design or implementation (yes, even when they deserve it).
