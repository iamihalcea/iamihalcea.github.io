                        I'm a software engineer and I started this blog as a means of motivating myself to dig deeper into topics that I enjoy or find interesting.
                        Most of my interests revolve around security in the context of software engineering - everything from hardware security solutions like TPMs,
                        to SQL injection attacks. This is not to say that I expect or want anyone else would find any of the stuff I write useful.

                        Apart from technical topics, I write the occasional post^Wrant on economics, psychology or anything else that sparks my fancy. These are
                        obviously 100% expert opinions, served to the internet straight from my armchair as I sip a measure of bourbon.
